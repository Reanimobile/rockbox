The NVP map varies a lot from players to players, it is inconceivable to build
it by hand. The approach taken is to extract it from the kernel of each player.
Since Sony provides the kernel of all players, it is 'only' a matter of
downloading all of them. A bit of back story on the NVP: it is non-volatile
area of the flash that is divided in regions and then "sectors" (unrelated to
hard drive sectors). Each "sector" stores the data of a "node". The ABI
between the NVP driver and the userspace is an index: the userspace gives the
index of a node, and then drives looksup its table to see where it is and what
is its size. The index map changes over time so Sony introduces standard "names"
for its entries, those are 3-letters acronym (for example "fup" or "bti" or "shp")
that have a corresponding index. For some reason, the driver also contains a
description of the nodes, in english (so "bti" stands for "boot image").

parse_nvp_header.sh
===================

This script is given a file name, a kernel directory or a kernel tgz and it will
try to extract the mapping automatically. It produces a list of pairs
  <node>,<name>
where <node> is the index of the node (that's the only thing that is usable on
a running device) and <name> is the standard name of the node. Note that is
some kind of acronym (like 'fup') and the description needs to be generated
separatly (see other section).

parse_all_nvp_headers.sh
========================

This scripts expects a directory to have the following structure:
  dir/
    nwz-a10/
      linux-kernel-*.tgz
    nwz-e460/
      linxu-kernel-*.tgz
    ...
Each sudirectory must the series name (as used in ../series.txt) and the kernel
must be a tgz (end in .tgz and not .tar.gz) of the form linux-kernel-*.tgz. Usually
the variable bit will be the version but some kernels have unknown versions. It
will then run parse_nvp_header.sh on each of them and store the result in a
file called <series name>.txt

NOTE: the kernel can be symlinks to other files

nvptool
=======

The kernel headers do no contain the description of the nvp node names.
This one can be extract from the icx_nvp[_emmc].ko driver on target using complicated
elf parsing done by nvptool. Technically nvptoo can find much more information
like the node -> humanname mapping as well and the actual sector on the disk but
since we can already extract it easily from the headers, we only extract description
names from it.

parse_all_nvp_nodes.sh
======================

This scripts expects a directory to have the following structure:
  dir/
    nwz-a10/
      rootfs.tgz
    nwz-e460/
      rootfs.tgz
    ...
Each sudirectory must the series name (as used in ../series.txt) and the rootfs
must be a tar. It will then extract the relevant icx_nvp driver from it and run
nvptool on it to produce a file called nodes-<series name>.txt

NOTE: the rootfs can be symlinks to other files
