Platform tools
--------------

Those tools are designed to run on the devices. They are mostly tests that can
be run in firmware upgrade mode (using exec_file in utils/nwztools/scripts/). To
compile those, you will need the sony nwz cross compiler. The canonical way to
run them is as follows:

1) Build the tools:
    cd /path/to/utils/nwztools/plattools
    make
Note that the default cross compiler prefix is arm-sony-linux-gnueabi- but it
can be changed using PREFIX:
PREFIX="sony-nwz-linux-gnueabi-" make

2) Embed the wanted excutable in a firmware upgrade for your device. The README
in utils/nwztools/scripts contains more documentation on how to select the right
target. For example if you want to embed test_display for the NWZ-E460 series,
you should run:
    cd /path/to/utils/nwztools/scripts
    make exec_file UPG=test_display_nwze46x.upg NWZ_TARGET=nwz-e46x EXEC=../plattools/test_display.elf

3) Put the upgrade file on the device and trigger a firmware upgrade. Assuming
your NWZ device is /dev/sdb1 and is mounted at /media/pamaury/WALKMAN, run:
    cd /path/to/utils/nwztools/scripts
    make copy_fw_upgrade UPG=test_display_nwze46x.upg NWZ_MOUNT=/media/pamaury/WALKMAN/
    sudo make do_fw_upgrade NWZ_DEV=/dev/sdb1
